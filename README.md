# ⚔️ vs-split: a library for creating adversarial splits

Have you ever encountered a problem where **your model works well in your test set
but doesn't perform well in the wild?**  It's likely because your test set does
not reflect the reality of your domain, overestimating your model's performance.[^1]

This library provides **alternative ways to split and sanity-check your datasets**
and ensure they're robust once you deploy them into production.

[^1]: Check out my blog post, [*Your train-test split may be doing you a disservice*](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/2022/08/30/adversarial-splits/), for a technical overview of this problem.

## ⏳ Installation

You can install `vs-split` via `pip`

```sh
pip install vs-split
```

Or alternatively, you can install from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/vs-split
cd vs-split
python setup.py install
```

## 👩‍💻 Usage

The library exposes two main functions: 

- **`train_test_split(X: Iterable, y: Iterable, split_id: str, **attrs)`** that accepts [NumPy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) of your features and labels. You can pass any arbitrary NumPy array or list for splitting.
- **`spacy_train_test_split(docs: Iterable[Doc], split_id: str, **attrs)`** that accepts an iterable of [spaCy Doc objects](https://spacy.io/api/doc).[^2] [spaCy](https://spacy.io) is a Python library for natural language processing and the Doc object is one of its core data structures. This function is useful if you're working on linguistic data.  

For both functions, you can provide the type of split in the `split_id`
parameter (c.f. [splitters catalogue](#splitters-catalogue)) and pass custom
keyword-arguments.

```python
from vs_split import train_test_split, spacy_train_test_split

# For most datasets
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = train_test_split(X_data, y_data, split_id="wasserstein.v1")
# For spaCy Doc objects
docs_train, docs_test = spacy_train_test_split(docs, split_id="wasserstein-spacy.v1")
```

> **Note**
> It might look like `vs-split` has a similar API with [scikit-learn's
> `train_test_split`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html),
> but that's not the case.  Unlike the latter, `vs_split.train_test_split` doesn't expect
> an arbitrary number of iterables, and the keyword parameters are also different.

[^2]: vs-split has first-class support for spaCy. The main reason is that I've been using this for some internal robustness experiments to test some of our [pipeline components](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines).

### Registering your own splitters

You can also register custom splitters via the `splitters` catalogue. Here's an
example of a splitter, `random-spacy.v1` that splits a list of spaCy Doc objects
given a training set size:

```python
import random
from typing import Iterable

from spacy.tokens import Doc
from vs_split.splitters import splitters

@splitters.register("random-spacy.v1")
def random_spacy(docs: Iterable[Doc], train_size: float):
    random.shuffle(docs)
    num_train = int(len(docs) * train_size)
    train_docs = docs[:num_train]
    test_docs = docs[num_train:]
    return train_docs, test_docs
```

Under the hood, `vs-split` uses
[`catalogue`](https://github.com/explosion/catalogue) to manage the functions
you registered. You are given freedom to return any value / object in your
splitter implementation&mdash;i.e, there's no function that enforces you to
follow the blueprint. However, for consistency, it's advisable to follow the
type signature of the other splitters.

### More examples

You can find more in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/vs-split/tree/main/examples)
directory. It contains a sample project that runs the [English WikiNeural
dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wikineural) on various spaCy
splitters.

## 🎛 API

### <kbd>function</kbd> `train_test_split`

Split a dataset into its training and testing partitions. By default, it should
return the training and testing features and labels respectively. 

| Argument    | Type       | Description                                            |

### <kbd>function</kbd> `spacy_train_test_split`

| Argument    | Type         | Description                                            |

### Splitters Catalogue

### <kbd>vs_split.splitters</kbd> `wasserstein.v1`

Perform adversarial splitting using a divergence maximization method involving [Wasserstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric).

This method approximates the test split by performing nearest-neighbor search on
a random centroid. Based on Søgaard, Ebert et al.'s work on '[We Need to Talk
About Random Splits](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.156/)' (EACL 2021).

| Argument    | Type       | Description                                            |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `*X`        | Iterable   | An iterable of features, preferably a `numpy.ndarray`. |
| `*y`        | Iterable   | An iterable of labels, preferably a `numpy.ndarray`.   |
| `test_size` | float      | The number of neighbors to query. Defaults to `0.2`    |
| `leaf_size` | int        | The leaf size parameter for nearest neighbor search. High values are slower. Defaults to `3`.    |
| **RETURNS** | Tuple[Iterable[Any], Iterable[Any], Iterable[Any], Iterable[Any]] | The training and testing features and labels (i.e. `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`) |
