# 🪐 spaCy Project: Adversarial Splitting Examples

This project shows different adversarial splitting examples
in some machine learning datasets (most are NLP).


## 📋 project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `convert-wikineural` | Convert Wikineural dataset into spaCy Docs |
| `convert-wnut17` | Convert WNUT17 into spaCy Docs |
| `convert-conll2003` | Convert ConLL2003 into spaCy Docs (IOB files are shipped together with this project) |
| `demo` | Run the Divergence Maximization demo |

### 🗂 Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.
